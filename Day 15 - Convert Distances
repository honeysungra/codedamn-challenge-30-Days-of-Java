Question 15 - Convert Distances

In this lab, you will implement two methods in Java to convert distances between miles and kilometers. Your task is to ensure these methods handle calculations accurately, even in edge cases.

Objectives
Convert Miles to Kilometers: Implement a method named convertToKilometers in the Main class. This method should take a double parameter representing miles and return the equivalent distance in kilometers.

Convert Kilometers to Miles: Implement a method named convertToMiles in the Main class. This method should take a double parameter representing kilometers and return the equivalent distance in miles.

Edge Cases and Precision
Be mindful of precision in your calculations. Since you are working with double data types, small discrepancies can occur. Your methods should be precise enough to handle edge cases, such as very large or very small values.

Examples
Example for convertToKilometers:
Input: 10 miles
Expected Output: 16.0934 kilometers (since 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers)
Example for convertToMiles:
Input: 16.0934 kilometers
Expected Output: 10 miles (since 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles)
Guidelines
Your methods must be part of the Main class.
Ensure your methods return values with a reasonable level of precision.
Test your methods with various inputs to make sure they work as expected.
Challenges Information
Challenge 1: Proper Functionality of convertToKilometers
Objective: Implement the convertToKilometers method in the Main class to accurately convert a given distance from miles to kilometers. The method should take one parameter of type double (miles) and return a double (kilometers). The conversion should adhere to the standard conversion rate (1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers). Be mindful of the precision in your calculation; the results will be compared with a tolerance for floating-point calculations.

Challenge 2: Proper Functionality of convertToMiles
Objective: Implement the convertToMiles method in the Main class to accurately convert a given distance from kilometers to miles. The method should take one parameter of type double (kilometers) and return a double (miles). The conversion should follow the standard conversion rate (1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles). Precision is key; your results will be evaluated with a certain tolerance for floating-point arithmetic.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        double miles = 10;
        double kilometers = 16.0934;

        double convertedToKilometers = convertToKilometers(miles);
        double convertedToMiles = convertToMiles(kilometers);

        System.out.println(miles + " miles is " + convertedToKilometers + " kilometers.");
        System.out.println(kilometers + " kilometers is " + convertedToMiles + " miles.");


        
    }

    public static double convertToKilometers(double miles) {
        return miles*1.60934;
    }

    public static double convertToMiles(double kilometers) {
        return Math.round(kilometers*0.621371);
    }
}
