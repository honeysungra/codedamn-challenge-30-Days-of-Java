Question 4 - Reverse a string

In this lab, your task is to implement a reverseString method that takes a string as input and returns its reverse without using any built-in string reversal functions. This method should be static and part of a class named Main.

Your method should satisfy the following conditions:

It must be public and static.
It must be named reverseString.
It must return a String.
It must take a single String parameter.
Examples:
If your method is called with reverseString("codedamn"), it should return nmadedoc.
If your method is called with reverseString("123"), it should return 321.
Ensure that your method handles these cases correctly and does not rely on any built-in string reversal methods provided by Java or its libraries. Good luck!

-------------------------------------------------Solution ------------------------------------------------

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage of the reverseString method
       

        String example1 = reverseString("codedamn");
        String example2 = reverseString("123");

        // Output the results
        System.out.println(example1); // Expected output: nmadedoc
        System.out.println(example2); // Expected output: 321
    }


    // Create "reverseString" method to reverse a string
    public static String reverseString(String str){
        String s="";

        for(int i=str.length()-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            char ch=str.charAt(i);
            s=s+ch;
        }
        return s;
    }

}
